in the last section VS run the sequent code:
```
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

int main()
{
    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(800, 600), "My window");

    while (window.isOpen()) {
        sf::Event event;
        while (window.pollEvent(event)) {
            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
                window.close();
        }

        window.clear();
        
        window.display();
    }
    return 0;
}
```
generating a 800x600 black window.

> #include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

In the first line of the code is imported [Graphics.hpp](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/group__graphics.php) a Subclasses of [window.hpp](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/group__window.php) therefore exploiting Inheritance is possible to use directly the methods of **Graphics.hpp** for both create the window and draw in it.

>sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(800, 600), "My window");

this line instantiate an object of [RenderWindow](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/classsf_1_1RenderWindow.php) class where they are given as parameters a [VideoMode](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/classsf_1_1VideoMode.php) and a string.
**videoMode** receives as parameters a width and a height (in pixels) and a depth (in bits per pixel) and pass this information to **RenderWindow** to create a window of the specified size.
The string "My window" will be the name given to the window.
